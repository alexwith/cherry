# Cherry

Cherry is an ORM (Object-relational mapping) tool that tries to achieve a simple and logic way of interacting with databases. While at
the same time avoiding bloated dependencies and the requirement to install IDE plugins for code generation.

## Getting Started

First of all you need to add Cherry as a dependency to your Java project.

**Gradle**<br>

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation("")
}
```

**Maven**<br>

```xml

```
